**mqtt-presence** is a lightweight Python-based presence indicator for MQTT systems. Originally designed for Raspberry Pi environments, it now supports Windows, Linux. It reports the online status of a device (e.g., a PC) and listens for shutdown or restart commands.  
It is especially useful in smart home environments such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) in combination with a mqtt broker.

```bash
mqtt-presence-vx.x.x.exe
```


#### üìù Or using script
The install script in github can also be used, which performs the same installation as the installer:

```powershell
# Install
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernboeckle/mqtt-presence/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex

# Uninstall
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernboeckle/mqtt-presence/main/scripts/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

### üê≥ Docker

Shutdown/Restart are not supported if running in a container and therefore they are disabled by default.

#### Docker compose
```yaml
services:
  mqtt-presence:
    image: bjoernboeckle/mqtt-presence:latest
    container_name: mqtt-presence
    volumes:
      - ./config/:/config
      - ./log/:/log
    network_mode: host      
```
---


### üêß Linux

Just use the install / uninstall script.
mqtt-presence will be installed as system.d service.

```bash
# Install
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernboeckle/mqtt-presence/main/scripts/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash

# Uninstall
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjoernboeckle/mqtt-presence/main/scripts/uninstall.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes
```

## üõ† Configuration

Configuration files are created on first run.

### Application Settings: (`configuration.yaml`)

This file is configured using the webUI.

```yaml
# Configuration file for MQTT Presence
# Please refer to the documentation for details on how to configure.
app:
  updateRate: 2
  webServer:
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8100
